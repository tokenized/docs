## Introduction

The Tokenized protocol features a complete messaging suite for all types of messaging including general purpose private and public messaging, as well as commercial, financial and legal messaging in accordance with a variety of established Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards. They are also used to allow smart contracts to share information and orchestrate multiple signature transactions, such as atomic swaps.

<a name="reverted-tx"></a>

#### Reverted Tx

A message that contains a bitcoin transaction that was accepted by the network or an agent and then invalidated by a reorg, or zero conf double spend. This serves as on chain evidence of the sending party&#39;s signatures and approval for the given transaction.

<a name="offer"></a>

#### Offer

A message that contains all of the details required for an agreement to be formed. Sent to an address(es). The Offer should have all, or nearly all, of the details required for the receiving party to accept the offer. The Offer shall be in the form of a partially formed Bitcoin transaction with all of the relevent details (offer, consideration, offeror&#39;s payment/receipt details, etc.). The Offer message is different to a Signature Request message in that it is missing the offeree&#39;s payment/receipt details (eg. UTXOs). If the Offer message is well received by the offeree, then the offeree can add their relevent details (eg. inputs/outputs) and sign the transaction. If an additional signature is required from the offeror at this point, then the partially-signed transaction can be sent to the offeror by way of a Signature Request message.

<a name="signature-request"></a>

Partially-signed transactions (Tokenized actions, Bitcoin, Multisig, Threshold Signatures, etc.) can be passed around on-chain to the parties (including Smart Contracts) that still have to sign the transaction.

<a name="output-metadata"></a>

#### Output Metadata

Metadata associated with the output. Aka Transaction details. It is used to describe the purpose of the transaction and add other relevant information. Often encrypted (DH, RSA) to make it private for one or more parties. DH for b2b where multiple parties can see the description. RSA or the like for descriptions only visible to one of the transacting parties. Optional

<a name="initiate-relationship"></a>

#### Initiate Relationship

A message used to initiate a new relationship between 2 or more parties. The M1 container specifies the sender tx input and requested participant tx outputs. If there are more than 2 parties the encryption secret provided in the envelope protocol is used as the base encryption secret. If there are only 2 parties, then the ECDH secret of each key pair is used to encrypt each message.

                The flag can optionally be used to identify messages in the relationship so that all members don&#39;t have to be tagged in each message. It isn&#39;t needed for two party relationships, but is recommended for relationships with more members. It will be included in it&#39;s own op return for all message transactions. It is recommended to be a random 20 byte value similar to public key hashes. The flag will be the Payload of an Envelope protocol message with a Payload Protocol ID of &#34;F&#34;. If this value is not specified then there must be an output to the next key in the relationship chain for every member in the group.

                Type of encryption used for messages within the relationship. 0 - Encryption keys embedded in envelope protocol. 1 - Encryption key embedded in this message is used as base key for future messages.
