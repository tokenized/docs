## Introduction

Tokenized has a full and rich set of commands for the creation and modification of instruments under a smart contract. A single smart contract can be used to manage a very large number of instruments, each of which can be represented by different quantitiy of tokens. It is also possible to create non-fungible tokens by creating an instrument with quantity 1, and metadata specific to that instrument.

## Creating an Instrument

A Tokenized instrument is generated when a the administration of a token issuer presents a valid 'Instrument Definition' action to a smart contract. The smart contract checks only that the rules proposed in the offer are compliant with its logic, but the legal and regulatory aspects of distributing and managing the instruments must be managed by the administration of the contract issuer to ensure that instruments are transacted within all applicable laws and regulations.

### Instrument Definition <a name="instrument-definition"></a>

To create an 'Instrument Definition', the administration of the contract issuer must prepare an action that contains all of the required information such as:

- Instrument type
- Instrument rules (flags, trading restrictions, voting and governance)
- Quantity
- Fee rules for trading that instrument
- The instrument specific details in the Instrument Payload (Each instrument type has a different payload structure)

The Instrument Definition action is built and signed by the administration of the contract issuer before being sent to the smart contract Operator:

### Instrument Creation

When the smart contract receives the Instrument Definition action it unpacks the information and evaluates it. If the smart contract decides there are no issues, it builds an 'Instrument Creation' action in response which is sent onto the network. The Instrument Creation action contains a complete repeat of all of the information in the Instrument Definition action as an acknowledgement that the smart contract has accepted the instrument as valid.
The contract also adds four additional fields

- **InstrumentCode** - A unique code that is used to identify the instrument. It is generated by hashing the contract public key hash and the instrument index. SHA256(contract PKH + instrument index)
- **InstrumentIndex** - Index of the instrument in the contract. First is zero. The index is used to generate unique instrument codes.
- **Timestamp** - The time at which the smart contract built the Instrument Creation action
- **InstrumentRevision** - Set to zero for a new instrument. Increments by 1 each time the instrument is updated

## Updating an Instrument

To modify a Tokenized instrument, the administration of the contract issuer must first build an 'Instrument Modification' action which contains the necessary infomration required for the smart contract to authorise and issue responses that update the instrument properties.

<a name="instrument-modification"></a>

### Instrument Modification

The action contains the Instrument Type and Instrument Code, which make up the Instrument ID. These fields cannot be modified.

Following on from these is the instrument revision, which is incremented by 1 each time the instrument is updated. An Instrument Modification request that doesn't have the current version number will be rejected.

Subsequent to these fields, the modifications to the instrument are contained in an array of objects, each of which has the following information:

- The field index of the contract element being changed
- The element of the field (for to identify the index number of the element within an array - complex types only)
- The Sub Field Index (to identify the field within the object in the array - complex types only)
- An instruction on whether to add or delete an element (for arrays)
- The new data being placed into the specified index

For instrument modifications that require a vote to be passed, the TXID of a Result action showing a positive vote outcome for the change must be added as the final data item in the Instrument Modification action. For detail on the voting process see the [Governance](governance) article.

<a name="instrument-creation-update"></a>

### Instrument Creation Update

When the contract sees the Instrument Modification action land in its wallet, it evaluates the action and looks to ensure that the modifications are valid.

If the contract determines that the amendment is valid, it issues a full Instrument Creation action including the full details of the instrument, the updated version number and a new timestamp.

From this moment, all transaction requests to the contract must abide by any amended rules that apply to the instrument.

## Instrument Types

When a tokenized instrument is created, it includes a payload that defines the metadata that are attached to that particular token or tokens. The tokenized protocol is broad enough that any type of token can be developed and created.

For the initial release of the Tokenized Protocol, the following 6 instrument types will be available:

<a name="coupons-cou"></a>

### Coupons (COU)

Coupons represent an instrument that gives the bearer a right to procure a good or service with terms that are different to those under which someone without a coupon would need to agree to. This may include a discounted price, longer warranty, free installation or any other add-on or benefit.

<a name="loyalty-points-loy"></a>

### Loyalty Points (LOY)

Loyalty points allow a merchant or business to reward repeat customers with tokens that can later be redeemed for discounted or free goods and services. Examples include coffee tokens (buy 10 coffees, get one free), airline miles (1 point per mile flown) and more.

<a name="membership-mem"></a>

### Membership (MEM)

A membership token is a token that is usually handed out in a quantity of one. The possession of a membership token signifies the belonging of the bearer to a defined group. As a few examples, membership tokens can be used to represent membership in a Board of Directors, a non-profit organization, or even a special interest club. Membership tokens can allow access to certain rights/privileges that members of the particular group are entitled, as well as any duties/responsibilities. This might include entry to a physical location such as a gym or club, or entry to a restricted part of a website such as a forum or members only zone.

### Common Share (SHC)

A common share is a share of a company providing the owner with a right to vote at shareholder meetings and to receive a part of the company profits as a dividend.

<a name="admission-ticket-tic"></a>

### Admission Ticket (TIC)

An admission ticket confers upon its owner a certain right, especially to enter a place, travel by public transport, or participate in an event. Once the ticket has been 'redeemed', the record of ownership remains in the users wallet similar to a 'ticket stub'. Tickets can be used for any event including conferences, arena concerts, sports events, or to buy pay per view rights to an event streamed over the internet.

<a name="currency-cur"></a>

### Currency (CUR)

Currency represents a tokenized version of a fiat currency. This is something that is issued and controlled by a legally entitled entity as a representative token of the currency being tokenized.
