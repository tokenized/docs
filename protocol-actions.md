## Introduction

The following actions break down the construction of a Tokenized protocol message. The action is constructed by building a single string from each of the elements in order. Each field within the action is given a specific type, including standard types and compound types.

See the [Transactions article](../concepts/transactions) for details on how to construct a complete transaction.

#### Contract Offer

Allows the administration to tell the smart contract what they want the details (labels, data, T&amp;C&#39;s, etc.) of the Contract to be on-chain in a public and immutable way. The Contract Offer action &#39;initializes&#39; a generic smart contract that has been spun up by either the smart contract operator or the administration. This on-chain action allows for the positive response from the smart contract with either a Contract Formation Action or a Rejection Action.

#### Contract Formation

This txn is created by the contract (smart contract/off-chain agent/token contract) upon receipt of a valid Contract Offer Action from the administration. The smart contract will execute on a server controlled by the administration, or a smart contract operator on their behalf.

#### Instrument Definition

This action is used by the administration to define the properties/characteristics of the instrument (token) that it wants to create. An instrument has a unique identifier called InstrumentID = InstrumentType &#43; base58(InstrumentCode &#43; checksum). An instrument is always linked to a contract that is identified by the public address of the Contract wallet.

#### Transfer

A Token Owner(s) Sends, Exchanges or Swaps a token(s) or Bitcoin for a token(s) or Bitcoin. Can be as simple as sending a single token to a receiver. Or can be as complex as many senders sending many different instruments - controlled by many different smart contracts - to a number of receivers. This action also supports atomic swaps (tokens for tokens). Since many parties and contracts can be involved in a transfer and the corresponding settlement action, the partially signed T1 and T2 actions will need to be passed around on-chain with an M1 action, or off-chain.

#### Rejection

Used to reject request actions that do not comply with the Contract. If money is to be returned to a User then it is used in lieu of the Settlement Action to properly account for token balances. All Administration/User request Actions must be responded to by the Contract with an Action. The only exception to this rule is when there is not enough fees in the first Action for the Contract response action to remain revenue neutral. If not enough fees are attached to pay for the Contract response then the Contract will not respond.

### Administrator Identity Certificate

A certificate provided by an identity oracle to verify the administrator address is associated with the issuer entity identification information. Also if a contract operator is provided then it verifies that the contract operator address is associated with the specified contract operator identity information. For a child contract that references a parent entity contract the certificate verifies that the administrator address is associated with that entity contract.

A QuantityIndex contains a quantity, and an index. The quantity could be used to describe a number of tokens, or a value. The index is used to refer to an input or output index position.

### Service

A definition of a service provided by an identity oracle to verify the administrator address is associated with the issuer entity identification information. Also if a contract operator is provided then it verifies that the contract operator address is associated with the specified contract operator identity information. For a child contract that references a parent entity contract the certificate verifies that the administrator address is associated with that entity contract.

        <td>
            R - Relative Threshold, A - Absolute Threshold, P - Plurality.  Relative Threshold means the number of counted votes must exceed the threshold % of total ballots cast.  Abstentations/spoiled votes do not detract from the likelihood of a vote passing as they are not included in the denominator.  Absolute Threshold requires the number of ballots counted to exceed the threshold value when compared to the total outstanding tokens.  Abstentations/spoiled votes detract from the likelihood of the vote passing.  For example, in an absolute threshold vote, if the threshold was 50% and 51% of the total outstanding tokens did not vote, then the vote cannot pass.  50% of all tokens would have had to vote for one vote option for the vote to be successful. Plurality means the most favoured option is selected, regardless of the number of votes cast or the percentage relative to other choices.

            This field is ignored when VoteType is P (Plurality). Otherwise it is the percentage of ballots required for a proposal to pass. Valid values are greater than 0 and less than 100. 75 means 75% and greater.  Only applicable to Relative and Absolute Threshold vote methods.  The Plurality vote method requires no threshold value (NULL), as the successful vote option is simply selected on the basis of highest ballots cast for it.
