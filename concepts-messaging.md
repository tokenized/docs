## Introduction

The Tokenized Protocol includes a rich and expressive set of messaging actions which allow issuers, operators and users the flexibility to correspond in a way that gives wallets, account management and audit software the ability to record a full set of transactional actions.
Messaging actions are split into two types, the Message action and Rejection action.

## Message action

Message actions are for general purpose messaging between users. The protocol has the means to support pre-defined message types allowing messaging to be used for many things including:

- Transaction templates
- Purchase Orders and Invoices
- Receipts
- Shipping notices
- Tags
- Transaction descriptions
- Quartlery/Yearly Reports (10K, 10Q, etc)
- Collateral Calls
- Encrypted messages
- Public (cleartext) messages
- And many other types

Message actions do not, generally, involve a smart contract and only serve to record communication data to the blockchain. The message action format is standardised to ensure that any wallets which follow the Tokenized Protocol will be able to identify, parse and categorize messages.
A message may be sent to many addresses at once by appending multiple outputs to the transaction which contains the Message action.

There are 6 Message types currently defined in the Tokenized Protocol:

- Public message: Message #0002 - A generic public message or public announcement. Sent to an address(es). Can be used for an official issuer announcement.

- Private message: Message #0003 - A generic private message. Sent to another address(es). Encryption is to be used.

- Reverted Tx: Message#0004 - A message that contains a bitcoin transaction that was accepted by the network or an agent and then invalidated by a reorg, or zero conf double spend. This serves as on chain evidence of the sending party's signatures and approval for the given transaction.

- Offer message: Message #1001 - A message that contains all of the details required for an agreement to be formed. Sent to an address(es). The Offer should have all, or nearly all, of the details required for the receiving party to accept the offer. The Offer shall be in the form of a partially formed Bitcoin transaction with all of the relevent details (offer, consideration, offeror's payment/receipt details, etc.). The Offer message is different to a Signature Request message in that it is missing the offeree's payment/receipt details (eg. UTXOs). If the Offer message is well received by the offeree, then the offeree can add their relevent details (eg. inputs/outputs) and sign the transaction. If an additional signature is required from the offeror at this point, then the partially-signed transaction can be sent to the offeror by way of a Signature Request message.

- Signature Request message: Message #1002 - Partially-signed transactions (Tokenized actions, Bitcoin, Multisig, Threshold Signatures, etc.) can be passed around on-chain to the parties (including Smart Contracts) that still have to sign the transaction.

- Settlement Request message: Message #1003 - A message that contains a multi-contract settlement that needs settlement data added by another contract. Sent to another contract to request data be added.

As the Tokenized Protocol matures, it is expected that many more message types will be introduced which enable new and exciting functionality to be handled simply and easily.

## Rejection action

The rejection action is the only message type sent by the smart contract. The Rejection action is used when a user has requested an action that is unable to be completed by the smart contract. All rejection messages include a rejection type, which links to a message telling the user why their request was rejected.
